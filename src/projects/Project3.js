          <h3>Project Goal and Approach</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Designed and built Lamp Buddy for the Lutron Lighting Innovation Challenge 2024, a smart study lamp that helps students stay focused by minimizing phone distractions.</strong> The lamp features ultrasound sensors for touch-free operation, a timer system that enables study sessions with scheduled breaks, and adjustable mood lighting to create an optimal study environment. My approach involved integrating hardware components like ultrasound sensors and LED strips with a microcontroller, programming the logic using Arduino, and designing a user-friendly interface to control the lampâ€™s features.

              The design concept for Lamp Buddy focused on creating a sleek, modern study lamp that blends functionality with aesthetics:
              <ul className="goal-list">
                <li>Incorporated a minimalist cylindrical design with a matte black finish.</li>
                <li>Positioned ultrasound sensors on top for touch-free interaction.</li>
                <li>Integrated an LED strip around the base for adjustable mood lighting.</li>
              </ul>
